# Data-cleaning-and-visulization-in-python
I used different datasets here to clean them and get insights from those datasets. also i visualized the data by plotting graphs,boxplots,scatterplots,pie charts etc. I used pandas to read dataset,matplotlib and seaborn to visualize dataset and numpy for numerical data. I used different datasets here like Titanic dataset, sales dataset,life expectancy dataset,Laptop price dataset,weather dataset, beers and breweries dataset etc.
